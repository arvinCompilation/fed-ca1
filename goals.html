                Marked as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13, <strong>taking action against climate
                change has never proven more important in history.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I strive for numerous goals in order to save our world, and hopefully you can too.

                        <h3>Net Zero Emissions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Personally, my number one goal is to <strong>achieve net zero emissions by 2030.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cutting back on carbon emissions is not easy, but possible. Here are some ways I am able to
                            reach this goal, to inspire you to do the same.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not eat meat on Mondays and turn to healthier alternatives such as tofu and beans.</li>
                            <li>Opt for fans instead of air conditioning when going to sleep.</li>
                            <li><strong>Always never waste food.</strong> Keep leftovers for later.</li>
                            <li>Choose to bike to school instead of asking my parents to drive me.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
                        <p>
                            What more direct way is there to combat climate change than to save and use clean energy?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Saving energy not only reduces carbon footprint but also saves money!</strong> Not to mention, clean
                            energy is renewable and rests us assured that little by little, we can make our own impact
                            on the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This goal goes hand-in-hand with my goal of Net Zero Emissions, but takes a different approach to achieve.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Go for energy-efficient appliances when buying refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, etc.</li>
                            <li>Use energy-saving modes for devices such as laptops and phones.</li>
                            <li>Turn off electrical appliances when not in use.</li>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Recycle properly, cleaning recyclables before recyling them and throwing them in the proper categories.</li>
                            <li>Use a personal metal straw when having drinks.</li>

               Why not join me on my goals, doing our part to save the world? Individually, we may not do much. However, together, we
               can prevail.
